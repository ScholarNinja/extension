When you install the Chrome Extension, you should be able to connect to the
network of nodes and assume membership of network, and be able to search for
keywords immediately.

✓ Recovering from browser exit
  ✓ Index is not restored yet
- Storing documents by docId instead of URL (hash of content)
- Ability to become node for certain keywords (DHT)
  - Find node is responsible for keyword - store in local index
  - If not, find closest node and send to their index
  - Abstract travels with document for keyword highlighting
- Node bootstrapping
- Add local search for PLOS, ArXiV, PubMed and other APIs.
- Save Peer id and Peer entries before
MAYBE
