When you install the Chrome Extension, you should be able to connect to the
network of nodes and assume membership of network, and be able to search for
keywords immediately.

✓ Recovering from browser exit
  ✓ Index is not restored yet
✓ Storing documents by docId instead of URL (hash of content)
✓ Node bootstrapping
✓ Save Peer id and Peer entries before
Solved because we're using webrtc-chord:
✓ Ability to become node for certain keywords (DHT)
  ✓ Find node is responsible for keyword - store in local index
  ✓ If not, find closest node and send to their index
✓ Solve performance issue
  Solved by not using browserify on webrtc-chord and using the release directly.

Pending

- Look at node-webkit standalone new version
+- Abstract travels with document for keyword highlighting
